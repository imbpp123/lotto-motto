Simple project to show LOTTO results

I started this project to gain more experience with GoLang. How it works?

1. It downloads file with results from lotto berlin website
2. Get last N rows
3. Splits number row into several parts and selects number randomly using weight for this part. I'll try to explain how it works late :)

DO NOT THINK THAT YOU CAN WIN WITH ANY STRATEGY IN LOTTO!
IT IS IMPOSSIBLE!
THIS PROJECT IS JUST FOR FUN!
